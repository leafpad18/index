    Securely moving forward with Serverless Architecture
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">

    <p class="card-text">Serverless Architecture is undoubtedly much more cost efficient than a traditional server setup. When compared to traditional client/server networks serverless presents a wider attack surface creating a greater risk for the business. Configuration and management of credentials are the most important aspect in securing serverless. This indicates that the biggest vulnerability in serverless is fundamentally the employees of the company. As shown in numerous misconfiguration breaches, the current security strategies are not suited for serverless. Furthermore, a business must leave their fate in the hands of a third party company who usually places their own interests first. To manage these risks presented by serverless architecture, businesses need to shift to a holistic Defense in Depth strategy.

    Zero knowledge proofs: Why we need better technical standards
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">Zero knowledge proofs are cryptographic proofs which have the ability to prove a piece of information without revealing anything about it. This will be instrumental in creating privacy preserving systems in the future. Currently the most well known use of zero knowledge proofs are zk-SNARKs.They are utilized by the Z-CASH blockchain to provide anonymity to transactions. However, like with any complicated technology computational succinctness is fragile. This means that without the proper oversight  by an independent government organisation these proofs may be misused or incorrectly used causing a breach in privacy.

    Case Study on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <br>
    On May 25th, 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  will come into effect for all natural EU people. Unlike the previous data privacy legislation this is a regulation not a directive. This means that it is binding legislation that all businesses must adhere to.

   Risk Management Project
 </div>
 <div class="card-body">

   <p class="card-text">Bank Z is an international bank and is interested in expanding their Mobile Banking department. While, Bank Z is an International Bank, all of its core systems are located in the midwest of the United States. In order to determine if additional funding will be required to expand Mobile Banking a risk assessment is being conducted to see if the current risk is being managed adequately.

This risk assessment took into account knowledge from:
Risk profile of each asset
Previous risk assessments
Likelihood of vulnerability / threat pairings to the asset
History of potential costs threat events may create
History of financial costs for controls

    This risk assessment shows that the most critical assets for Bank Z are Internet Banking, and Core Banking. Internet Banking had the highest Threat Score and Inherent Risk Score. Overall Desktops have the least Residual Risk and even though Internet Banking has the highest Control Score, it still has the highest Residual Risk.
    The results of this risk assessment shows that the current funds allocated for mitigating the risks for Bank Z is inadequate. This can be seen in the inherent risk score for one of the most critical assets, Internet Banking. Where the controls that can be afforded are only mitigating approximately 28% of the inherent risk of the asset. Therefore, Bank Z should look to invest in Internet Banking more than other assets in order to manage the risk. This should be done before moving onto expanding the Mobile Banking asset.
